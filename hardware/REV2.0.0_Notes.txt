mosfet for precharge path, d200, (d203 and d202 as well) footprint, layout of esp32 (not devboard take out 3v3 ldo), shorter return path, smaller precharge resistor lmr38020sddar order


There is a humming that is created both on the inductor and the buzzer when input voltage goes above 40V. Might have to increase the switching frequency? move the buzzer physically away from the circuit.


check the config when a phone is trying to charge but we have 5V_MCU


* 5v buck stays disabled even after removing the 5V_MCU (removing the micro usb connection)

LDO conducts in reverse when VIN > VOUT (get a different regulator that doesn't do this or add a diode/pmos in series with it)
    -this could be resolved by removing the 3v3 regulator on the dev board and only having one 5V signal (OR of usb and battery).


Reverse polarity doesn't actly protect the Buck regulator circuit (use a chip that has reverse polarity in it)


USBC charger can't actually charge lightning ports (it doesn't respect the cc resistors), must add USBC power delivery


Start developing a super nice kicad library


pull down between q500 gate and source (for the buzzer)


gotta init git everytime i wanna do esp32 project?
